# PREZZOTIMER ⏰ 🤔
# 

This project is for people who give presentations with lots of slides and want to avoid running overtime.

## My problem:
I believe in the concept of [one-idea-per-slide](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qKDvUO-hK5s). I run a [workshop](https://lu.ma/nascent) where I present ~250 slides over 2 hours, interspersed with lots of audience participation. So it's easy for the workshop to run long, but I want to respect my audience's time and keep to the planned 2 hours. So far, I've been [keeping time by manually](IMG_0532.jpeg) writing out a table of time on the clock and target slide number, which I then compare to the current slide. This is tedious and distracts from the preso. 

I wanna build "an app for that".


## Solution:
Input values
  - Presentation duration (e.g., 2 hours)
  - Total slides (e.g., 250) 
  - Start time (e.g., 2.30pm) since I'll launch this app 10 to 20 mins before I begin presenting.
 
Output: a timer that counts 1->250 over 2 hours so I can compare the slide timer with the current slide.

Future development: I use Google Presentations so I could see if I could link this app to gPreso so it would automatically see which slide I'm on and provide more useful feedback.
