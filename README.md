# PREZZOTIMER ⏰ 🤔

If you give presentations with lots of slides, then this project could help you.

## My problem:
I believe in the concept of [one-idea-per-slide](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qKDvUO-hK5s). I run a [workshop](https://lu.ma/nascent) where I present ~250 slides over 2 hours, interspersed with lots of audience participation. So it's easy for the workshop to run long, but I want to respect my audiences time and keep to the planned 2 hours. So far, I've been [keeping time by manually](IMG_0532.jpeg) writing out a table of time on the clock and target slide number, which I then compare to the current slide. This is tedious and distracts from the preso. 

I wanna build "an app for that".


Solution:
Input duration: 2 hours
Input total slides: 250
Output: timer that counts 1->250 over 2 hours so I can check ad hoc

Additional variable: launch this 10 to 20 mins before I begin presenting
Input: start time (2.30pm)

Assume: screen extension, not screen mirroring
